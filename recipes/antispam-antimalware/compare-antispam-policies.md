# Compare Antispam Policies

## Problem

You want to compare the differences between two antispam policies.

## Solution

A simple `Compare-Object` cmdlet will not give the results you might expect.
Use this approach to comparing each property

### Save The Policies to Variables

```powershell
$policy1 = Get-HostedContentFilterPolicy -Identity "ENTER FIRST POLICY NAME HERE"
$policy2 = Get-HostedContentFilterPolicy -Identity "ENTER SECOND POLICY NAME HERE"
```

Save the Properties of the new policy objects to a variable called `$props`.

```powershell
$props = $policy1 | 
Get-Member -MemberType Properties |
Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name
```

### Compare Each Property and Show Only The Differences

```powershell
$props | Foreach-Object {if($policy1.($_) -ne $policy2.($_){Write-Host $_ ": " $policy1.($_) "<>" $policy2.($_)})}
```

## Discussion

This is a quick way to show the differences between policies.
The results are noisy.
You will see obvious differences like Name, Guid, Created and Modified Dates, etc.
