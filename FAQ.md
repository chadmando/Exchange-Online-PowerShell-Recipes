# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why Create This Repo?

Consolidate, Remember, and Share.
After using PowerShell to manage Exchange Online, I began collecting small scripts and one-liners for common tasks.
Developing these pieces of code took time.
It involved searching the internet and reading documentation then writing, testing, tweaking, and finding a place to save the code.
For some, this is an enjoyable process.
Others would like to find the answer and move on.
This project was created for people who need to complete a task but want to skip the research project.

## Can't I Just Use the Exchange Admin Portal?

Sometimes.
Many of the recipes' results can be found or in the Exchange Admin portal.
However, Microsoft frequently changes the availability and locations of settings and reports.
Besides, why use the admin portal when we can use PowerShell?

## Aren't You Just Making a Wrapper for Exchange Online?

No.
The recipes use the Exchange Online module to get things done.
Some scenarios might require a script instead of a series of cmdlets _piped_ together.
In those cases, a sample script may be provided.
Please review and test any script provided.
Use them at your own risk.
